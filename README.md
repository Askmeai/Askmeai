## Introduction

Hundreds of new tokens are created every day, with some of them having significant growth potential. However, thoroughly scanning and examining hundreds of projects demands significant labor and time. Identifying the right grains of sand on the beach poses quite a challenge.
AskmeAI accomplishes this rapidly on your behalf. One of the key distinctions is that it goes beyond mere contract review. Some platforms solely examine the blockchain, namely the contract code, without the support of artificial intelligence. This approach is considerably insufficient, incomplete, and misleading. Moreover, many projects make use of pre-existing contracts. The contract structures are almost 99 percent identical. As will be demonstrated in the subsequent sections of the whitepaper, this leads to highly inaccurate outcomes.
The AskmeAI project is designed to be accessible to anyone, whether they are a professional or a new crypto investor. AskmeAI focuses on reviewing new projects, rather than dealing with major tokens or graphics. In the crypto world, where potential ponzi schemes abound, AskmeAI assesses and rates projects that have not yet been listed on exchange platforms. These projects are in their early stages and have relatively low market capitalization values.
AskmeAI does not engage with projects that are older than 30 days. Within this short timeframe, any support and resistance levels depicted on charts are unlikely to hold much significance.
AskmeAI conducts a comprehensive examination of projects across various dimensions. It tracks project developments over a period of time to gain insights that inform its evaluation of future projects. It evaluates numerous factors including Blockchain, Audit, Kyc, website quality, whitepaper content, privatesell initiatives, liquidity, and transfers. The evaluation culminates in a score that is divided into four distinct categories. A detailed explanation of the scoring system will be provided in the subsequent sections.
AskmeAI functions as a scanning tool and never provides investment advice. It swiftly scans new projects and pre-sales, thereby preventing users from wasting time. Relying solely on audit reviews or KYC ownership is insufficient; a comprehensive review that encompasses all details is necessary. The AskmeAI score will hold significant importance for projects that are newly entering the blockchain realm.
AskmeAI has successfully addressed the prevalent issue of alternative liquidity sources that many projects struggle with. Its innovative approach is likely to be widely adopted in the future. However, it may also attract unwarranted attention from malicious projects and communities due to its accuracy. This platform is poised to bring about irreversible changes in the world of promising tokens, particularly by highlighting their shortcomings for a cleaner crypto environment.

## What is AskmeAI?

AskMeAI is a revolutionary blockchain-powered platform that harnesses the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) to offer detailed and precise insights into the realm of cryptocurrency.
AskmeAI is an artificial intelligence-supported scoring platform, a listing platform where projects scanned using artificial intelligence are showcased, a 90-day staking platform for early-stage users, and a comprehensive structure guided by the 'clean crypto' motto, which conducts thorough and holistic evaluations of projects considering every factor.
Having a project with KYC doesn't necessarily guarantee its safety. Likewise, investing in a non-KYC project isn't just a gamble; it's essentially handing money directly to scammers. You might as well stand by the street-facing part of your house and throw your money onto the streetâ€”this would at least bring a moment of happiness to whoever finds it. This scenario seems more logical than investing in a project without KYC.
